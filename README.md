# Fashion Recommender System
Diverse body shapes play a pivotal role in clothing recommendations, yet existing methods often adopt a generic approach, overlooking the nuances of individual body types. Inspired by Facebook AI Research's "ViBE: Dressing for Diverse Body Shapes," our project introduces a novel VIsual Body-aware Embedding (ViBE)-based fashion recommender. ViBE captures clothing's affinity with different body shapes, addressing the limitations of body-agnostic vision methods. Trained on a dataset reflecting the spectrum of real body shapes, our approach identifies garments that complement specific body types, enhancing the inclusivity and personalization of fashion recommendations.

Methodologically, we leverage ViBE's principles, adapting them to our context. We learn the embedding from an extensive online catalog showcasing diverse body shapes, providing tailored recommendations. Our approach considers the complexities of clothing selection, prioritizing fit as a crucial factor in boosting wearer confidence and comfort. Through the exploration of ViBE's strategies, we aim to redefine the fashion recommendation landscape, promoting personalized and body-aware suggestions for users with diverse body shapes. This project extends beyond conventional body-agnostic methods, offering a promising avenue for reshaping the future of inclusive and personalized e-commerce experiences.
